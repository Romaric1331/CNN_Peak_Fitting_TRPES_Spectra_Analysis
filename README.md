# CNN Peak Fitting TRPES Spectra Analysis

Welcome to the repository documenting the work embarked upon during my journey as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at CNRS, within the prestigious Institut Photovolta√Øque d'Ile-de-France (IPVF). This repository showcases the research and development efforts under the guidance of esteemed mentors Philip Schulz, Jean-Baptiste Puel, and Arthur Julien, as part of the captivating project titled **"Analysis of Interfaces in Perovskite-Based Tandem Solar Cells with Advanced Spectroscopy and Data Science Techniques."**

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze interfaces in perovskite-based tandem solar cells. The main tasks undertaken in this research include:

1. **Introducing Uncertainties for Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks**  
   Implementing Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNNs) to account for uncertainties in predictions, enhancing the robustness and interpretability of the model.

2. **Incorporating the Bayesian Model with SparseDenseNet Network**  
   Integrating the Bayesian model with a SparseDenseNet architecture to optimize performance in handling the complex data associated with tandem solar cells.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning of Neural Networks**  
   Systematically tuning the hyperparameters of the neural networks to achieve optimal performance, balancing the trade-offs between various metrics.

4. **Error Function Comparison: MSE vs. MAE**  
   Evaluating the performance of the model using different error functions, specifically Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), to determine the most suitable metric for this analysis.

## Repository Contents
