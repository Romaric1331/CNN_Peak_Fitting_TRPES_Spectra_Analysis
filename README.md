# CNN_Peak_Fitting_TRPES_Spectra_Analysis
 The work is executed as Machine learning engineer internship at L'institut Photovolta√Øque d'Ile de France. In this work, I am using CNNs for accurately quantifying chemical states via Time-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy for Perovskite Solar cells and determining uncertainty with Bayesian Neural Networks.
